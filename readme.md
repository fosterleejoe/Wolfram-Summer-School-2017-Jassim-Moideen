## Project Title

Exploratory Data Analysis of Mobile Telecom CDR data with Wolfram Language.

## Project Description

Communication service providers produce large volumes of calling data records (CDR) every minute day in and day out with details like inbound calls, outbound calls, dropped calls, abandoned calls and unanswered calls.The data can include call detail data, network and customer data based on the configuration of the respective systems. Analysis of mobile telecom call detail records (CDR) provides greater insights into the telecom activity. This helps organizations track details on extensions, toll fraud and multiple locations, and it also helps them prevent productivity loss and control expenses.

The approach here is to curate the data for an EDA analysis and summarise the main characteristics of the CDR data sets that are generated and derive actionable insights. The outcome can be used for various business use cases like customer profiling, targeted marketing, product design, network fault isolation and fraud detection.

With the impeding risk of OTT VoIP cannibalization, the clear understanding of their customers behaviour is the vital for the business to maintain their steady revenue stream.
