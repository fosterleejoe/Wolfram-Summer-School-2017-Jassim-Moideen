## Project Title

Exploratory Data Analysis of Mobile Telecom CDR data with Wolfram Language.

## Project Description

Communication service providers produce large volumes of calling data records (CDR) every minute day in and day out. With the impeding fear of OTT VoIP cannibalization, the clear understanding of their customers behaviour is the key factor for the company to maintain the call revenue. Analysis of mobile telecom call detail records (CDR) provides greater insights into the telecom activity like inbound calls, outbound calls, dropped calls, abandoned calls and unanswered calls. This helps organizations track details on extensions, toll fraud and multiple locations, and it also helps them prevent productivity loss and control expenses. The approach here is to curate the data for an EDA analysis and summarise the main characteristics of the CDR data sets that are generated. The data can include call detail data, network and customer data. The outcome can be used for various business use cases like customer profiling, targeted marketing, product design, network fault isolation and fraud detection.
